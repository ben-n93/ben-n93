# Hi! 👋

I'm a data analyst based in Sydney, Australia.

- 🤖 I have a passion for creating tools and services from open-source data, like a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Gutenberg_SciFi) that posts recommendations of public domain science-fiction eBooks.
  
- 📖 Right now I'm focused on learning more about the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library, data engineering and geospatial data (I recently created a [command-line tool](https://github.com/ben-n93/geojson-shave) that reduces the size of GeoJSON files).
  
- 🌐 You can read more about me, including projects I've developed, on my [website](https://ben-nour.com/).
- 📫 To get in contact [email](mailto:hello@ben-nour.com) me or reach out via [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/benjamin_nour).
